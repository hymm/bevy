Ambiguity detection can be useful for detecting potential bugs where the schedule graph is underspecified. 

While conflicting pairs of systems without a specified order can produce bugs. Often ambiguities are useful too. Overspecifying the order can limit how many systems can run in parallel. The ambiguity detection system also does not understand run criteria, so mutually exclusive states will still be reported as ambiguities.
